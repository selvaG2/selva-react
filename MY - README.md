Concepts covered:

1. Why react?
    to reduce the javascript complexcity.

2. setup for react
    i)   node.js.
    ii)  npm.
    iii) npx create-react-app app-name.
    iv)  in the emmet add a language (javascript : javascriptreact) => file => preference => search emmet.
    v)   es7 extension for code snippet [ctrl+alt+r (rafce - create a react arrow function component with ES7)].

3. JSX (javascript and html)
    It is the mix of javascript and html code the html code will be in the return of the functional component.

4. Functional components
    A React functional component is a simple JavaScript function that accepts props and returns a React element. After the introduction of React Hooks, writing functional components has become the ​standard way of writing React components in modern applications.

5. react styling
    Two option :-
    1)Inline css
        i) {} using the currly brackets inside that we can add a name for the style and we can write the css in 
        seperate variable to multiple use.
        ii) using stylee={} this format.
    2)External css
        we can create a seperate name and id for the element and we can write css in seperate file.

6. click events
    There are may events that we can handle using this like:-
    1. click
    2. Dblclick
    3. onchange etc....

    in the click events if we are passing a function with parameters it will be ececuted wew page is loaded
    to avoid that in an ananymous funtion call that function.

    ex: 
        onClick={() => fun(par1,par2)}

7. useState hook
    This is a hook which is used to handle the state which is introduced in functional component.

    syntax: Const [value,setValue] = useState(initial value when page is loaded);

8. keys
9. icons    
    i)  npm install react-icons --save (to install react-icons)

10. Props and prop drilling
    passing some value to its child components like a parameter.
    
11. controlled inputs
